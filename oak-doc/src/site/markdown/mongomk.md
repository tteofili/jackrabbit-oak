Oak MongoMK
===========

This module contains a `MicroKernel` implementation using MongoDB to persist
content.

Content Model
-------------

The `MongoMK` stores each node in a separate MongoDB document and updates to
a node are stored by adding new revision/value pairs to the document. This way
the previous state of a node is preserved and can still be retrieved by a
session looking a given snapshot (revision) of the repository.

The basic MongoDB document of a node in Oak looks like this:

    {
        "_id" : "1:/node",
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "false"
        },
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13f3875b5d1-0-1"
        },
        "_commitRoot": {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1": 0
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274208361),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "c"
        }
    }

All fields in the above document are metadata and are not exposed through the
Oak API.

The `_id` field is used as the primary key and consists of a combination of the
depth of the path and the path itself. This is an optimization to align sibling
keys in the index.

The `_deleted` sub-document contains the revision this node was created in. In
the above example the root node was created in revision `r13f3875b5d1-0-1`. If
the node is later deleted, the `_deleted` sub-document will get a new field with
the revision the node was deleted in.

The sub-document `_lastRev` contains the last revision written to this node by
each cluster node. In the above example the MongoMK cluster node with id `1`
modified the node the last time in revision `r13f3875b5d1-0-1`, when it created
the node. These revisions are only updated for non-branch commits.

The `_modified` field contains a low-resolution timestamp when the node was last
modified. The time resolution is five seconds. This field is also updated when
a branch commit modifies a node.

The sub-document `_commitRoot` contains commit root depth for the commit in which
the node was created against the revision.

Finally, the `_revisions` sub-document contains commit information about changes
marked with a revision. E.g. the single entry in the above document tells us
that everything marked with revision `r13f3875b5d1-0-1` is committed and
therefore valid. In case the change is done in a branch then the value would be the
base revision. It is only added for thode nodes which happen to be the commit root
for any give commit.

Adding a property `prop` with value `foo` to the node in a next step will
result in the following document:

    {
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "false"
        },
        "_id" : "1:/node",
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13f38818ab6-0-1"
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274208516),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "c",
            "r13f38818ab6-0-1" : "c"
        },
        "prop" : {
            "r13f38818ab6-0-1" : "\"foo\""
        }
    }

Now the document contains a new sub-document with the name of the new property.
The value of the property is annotated with the revision the property was set.
With each successful commit to this node, a new field is added to the
`_revisions` sub-document. Similarly the `_lastRev` sub-document and `_modified`
field are updated.

After the node is deleted the document looks like this:

    {
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "false",
            "r13f38835063-2-1" : "true"
        },
        "_id" : "1:/node",
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13f38835063-2-1"
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274208539),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13f3875b5d1-0-1" : "c",
            "r13f38818ab6-0-1" : "c",
            "r13f38835063-2-1" : "c"
        },
        "prop" : {
            "r13f38818ab6-0-1" : "\"foo\""
        }
    }

The `_deleted` sub-document now contains a `r13f38835063-2-1` field marking the
node as deleted in this revision.

Reading the node in previous revisions is still possible, even if it is now
marked as deleted as of revision `r13f38835063-2-1`.

Revisions
---------

As seen in the examples above, a revision is a String and may look like this:
`r13f38835063-2-1`. It consists of three parts:

* A timestamp derived from the system time of the machine it was generated on: `13f38835063`
* A counter to distinguish revisions created with the same timestamp: `-2`
* The cluster node id where this revision was created: `-1`

Branches
--------

MicroKernel implementations support branches, which allows a client to stage
multiple commits and make them visible with a single merge call. In MongoMK
a branch commit looks very similar to a regular commit, but instead of setting
the value of an entry in `_revisions` to `c` (committed), it marks it with
the base revision of the branch commit. In contrast to regular commits where
the commit root is the common ancestor of all nodes modified in a commit, the
commit root of a branch commit is always the root node. This is because a
branch will likely have multiple commits and a commit root must already be
known when the first commit happens on a branch. To make sure the following
branch commits can use the same commit root, MongoMK simply picks the root
node, which always works in this case.

A root node may look like this:

    {
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "false",
        },
        "_id" : "0:/",
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13fcda91720-0-1"
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274708995),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "c",
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "c"
        },
        "prop" : {
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "\"foo\""
        }
    }

The root node was created in revision `r13fcda88ac0-0-1` and later
in revision `r13fcda91720-0-1` property `prop` was set to `foo`.
To keep the example simple, we now assume a branch is created based
on the revision the root node was last modified and a branch commit
is done to modify the existing property. After the branch commit
the root node looks like this:

    {
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "false",
        },
        "_id" : "0:/",
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13fcda91720-0-1"
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274708995),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "c",
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "c",
			"r13fcda919eb-0-1" : "r13fcda91720-0-1"
        },
        "prop" : {
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "\"foo\"",
			"r13fcda919eb-0-1" : "\"bar\"",
        }
    }

At this point the modified property is only visible to a reader
when it reads with the branch revision `r13fcda919eb-0-1` because
the revision is marked with the base version of this commit in
the `_revisions` sub-document. Note, the `_lastRev` is not updated
for branch commits but only when a branch is merged.

When the branch is later merged, the root node will look like this:

    {
        "_deleted" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "false",
        },
        "_id" : "0:/",
        "_lastRev" : {
            "1" : "r13fcda91b12-0-1"
        },
        "_modified" : NumberLong(274708995),
        "_revisions" : {
            "r13fcda88ac0-0-1" : "c",
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "c",
			"r13fcda919eb-0-1" : "c-r13fcda91b12-0-1"
        },
        "prop" : {
            "r13fcda91720-0-1" : "\"foo\"",
			"r13fcda919eb-0-1" : "\"bar\"",
        }
    }

Now, the changed property is visible to readers with a revision equal or
newer than `r13fcda91b12-0-1`.

The same logic is used for changes to other nodes that belong to a branch
commit. MongoMK internally resolves the commit revision for a modification
before it decides whether a reader is able to see a given change.

Background Operations
---------------------
Each MongoMK instance connecting to same database in Mongo server performs certain background task.

### Renew Cluster Id Lease

### Background Writes

While performing commits there are certain nodes which are modified but do not become part
of commit. For example when a node under /a/b/c is updated then the `_lastRev` property also
needs to be updated to the commit revision. Such changes are accumulated and flushed periodically
through a asynch job.
