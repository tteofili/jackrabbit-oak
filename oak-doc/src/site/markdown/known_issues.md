Known issues
============
All known issues are listed in the Apache [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK).
Changes with respect to Jackrabbit-core are collected in [OAK-14]
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-14) and its sub-tasks.

* Locking:
    * Locking and unlocking of nodes is not implemented yet. You will not see an exception as long as
      the [TODO](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-193)-flag prevents the implementation from
      throwing UnsupportedOperationException, but the node *will not* be locked.
      See [OAK-150](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-150)


* Versioning [OAK-168](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-168):
    * `VersionHistory#removeVersion()` is not implemented yet
    * `VersionManager#merge()` is not implemented yet
    * `VersionManager#restore()` with version-array is not implemented yet
    * Activities are not implemented
    * Configurations are not implemented


* Query:
    * Known issue with OR statements in full text queries
      See [OAK-902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-902)


* Workspace Operations:
    * Cross workspace operations are not implemented yet
      See [OAK-916](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-916)
    * Workspace Management (creating/deleting workspaces) is not implemented yet
      See [OAK-916](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-916)


In some cases Oak throws Runtime exceptions instead of a properly typed exception. We are working
on correcting this. Please do not work around this by adapting catch clauses in your application.
